##What is your sites primary purpose?

I want my site to be a porfotlio for the work I am completing for Enspiral Dev Academy.

##Who is your target audience?

Potential employers, family, friends

##How do you want site visitors to interact with your site. What experience would you like them to have?

I guess limited interaction. The site is to showcase my work, visitors need to be able to easily navigate the website however other than perhaps reaching out to contact me there shouldnt be much interaction. Its more of an exhibition than anything else.

##How will you build your site to support your desired user experience? 

I really don't know yet.... I will use my knowledge of CSS and Media queries to make the site accessible and aesthetically pleasing
but I am not sure beyond a basic idea of how I will achieve these goals. Lets see how it turns out?
